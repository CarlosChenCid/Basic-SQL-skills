/** Project 2: Design a shop database

Create your own shop! Your shop should sell only one type of thing, like clothes or bicycles, 
whatever you want your shop to specialise in. You should have one table for all the items in 
your shop, and at least 5 columns for the types of data you need to store. You should sell at 
least 15 items, use select statements to sort your items by price, and display at least one 
statistic about the items.
